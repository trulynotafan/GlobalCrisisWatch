# üåç Global Crisis Watch

A real-time global crisis monitoring dashboard that aggregates and visualizes data from multiple sources, including USGS earthquake data, international news, and emergency services.



## üéØ Project Overview

**Global Crisis Watch** was developed as a learning exercise to explore:
- Integrating multiple APIs and data sources
- Real-time data fetching and processing
- Async/Await patterns in TypeScript
- Geospatial data visualization with Leaflet
- React hooks and state management
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Dark mode UI/UX design principles
- Infinite scrolling and data pagination
- Ensuring TypeScript type safety and interfaces
